          Hello, Agent Smith! There is a button on that page, that does not want
          to perform its function - to reveal a secret piece of information,
          vital to our operation! The button left its original place and went
          off the grid. We are unable to pinpoint its exact location, but we
          know it is somewhere in the area below. Your mission, should you
          choose to accept it, is to gather the hidden information by finding
          and clicking that button! Your quick reactions and sergical precision
          is needed.

            The key to making extremely fluffy pancakes is entirely dependent on
            the way you handle just one ingredient: the eggs. Instead of
            incorporating entire eggs into your pancake batter all at once, try
            separating the yolks and the egg whites. Combine the yolks with the
            wet ingredients while placing the egg whites in the bowl of a stand
            mixer and whipping them over high speed until soft peaks form.
            Reserve until youâ€™ve combined all of the other ingredients and then
            GENTLY fold the whipped whites into the batter using a spatula.
            Next, the trick to fluffy pancakes is knowing how to fold egg whites
            into batter to preserve their airy consistency. Start by adding a
            dollop of the whipped egg whites on top of the batter. Then, using
            the blade of the spatula, cut through the center of the mixture,
            down to the bottom of the bowl. Scoop up one half of the mixture
            along the curve of the bowl and fold over into the remaining half.
            Repeat this process, turning the bowl clockwise every time, until
            all of the whites have been incorporated.
